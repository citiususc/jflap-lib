<H1>Combine Automata</H1>

<P>This combines two automata to form a new edu.duke.cs.jflap.automata. When invoked in one automaton, this oeprator
    searches for one or more automaton of the same type. The user then has a chance to select which of the others he
    wishes to combine with this automaton. Once selected, a new automaton with the states and transitions of both
    appears. Since an automaton may have only one initial state, the initial state of the automaton chosen in the dialog
    box is discarded. No transitions between the two automata will be created.</P>
